0.0.1 - Initial version on Debian 4, RHEL 3 & 5.

0.0.2 - Renamed DEBUG to _DEBUG_ to avoid conflic with Cardamon (and RETAIL to _RETAIL_ to be homegeneous)
      - Added user argument to the zo tool to be able to reach programs running on another account
      - tis_legacy_macros corrected.
      - New custom debug functions parameters added in the DebugFlags structure
      - API modified and ABI compatibility version management added to allow programs build for the previous one to use this version.
      - dynamicLogger added.
      - New functions to existing loggers (vFileLogger, openConsoleLogger, vconsoleLogger, vctxLogger) added.
      - goodies functions stringToSyslogLevel & stringToFacility added and exported.
      - New fileLogger option to change of file after a specified duration (flag LOG_FILE_DURATION).
      - Optionnal Large File Support added.
      - fileLogger honors the LOG_CONS & LOG_PERROR flags now.
      - New LOG_CLOCK flag to use the clock_gettime(3) to log a timestamp that represents monotonic time since some unspecified starting point.
        Needed on multi core and multi cpu architectures unless you use thread affinity (but more costly than RDTSC).

0.0.3 - A few corrections of Makefiles for the rpms generation and distcheck test.
      - template class facade (using TSD) to solve "C++ streams not threads safe bug" 
        (it doesn't mean that C++ streams are buggy, it was a bug in my library because i was not aware of this, i have always use streams to console previously that are the only ones thread safe !).

0.0.4 - A few corrections to build on a Debian 6 64bits.
      - pkgconfig test program build corrected when the library hase not been already installed.
      - the gettid internal function use the syscall function (instead of the "int 0x80" on x86) when building on a 2.6.x Linux kernel.
      - Buffer overflow correction in consoleLogger & fileLogger (use a stream buffer now instead of a buffer on the stack).
        and new test programs to check the library's logger with message of size up to 4096 bytes.
      - thread cancellation points management in fileLogger added (useless in the consoleLogger).
      - added instructions to free the used buffer in the thread cancellation points management of the syslogex logger (glibc bug ?)
      - New logger sending trace to one file per thtread

x.x.x - Two new flags taken into account by the loggers to file(s): 
         _ LOG_FILE_WITHOUT_SYNC: to disable all synchronous write to the disk.
         _ LOG_FILE_SYNC_ON_ERRORS_ONLY to disable all synchronous write to the disk except when the message is upper or equal to the error level.         
         Remark: the loggers to files default writing strategy is still synchronous write (O_SYNC flags set, cf. open(2) for details).
      - New build option (--with-filesystem-cache-flush-every) to set a threshold to try to reduce log write to file(s) footprint in the file system page cache.
      - New function: printf hook to be able to display integer as a binary string (%b).
      - 3 new build targets to produce Debian packages (dist-deb for the runtime only, dist-deb-dev for the runtime and headers, dist-deb-src for the source package).
